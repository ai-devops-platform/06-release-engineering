## 📌 Overview
This repository showcases **modern Release Engineering practices** focused on **safe, fast, and repeatable software delivery**.
It demonstrates how to design **CI/CD pipelines**, manage **progressive delivery**, and ensure **reliability, security, and traceability** across releases.

Release Engineering here bridges **DevOps, SRE, and Platform Engineering**.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Enable fast and reliable releases
- Reduce deployment risk using progressive delivery
- Standardize CI/CD pipelines across teams
- Improve rollback, traceability, and auditability
- Support high deployment frequency without downtime
